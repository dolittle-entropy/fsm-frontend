# TypeScript + XState + React + MaterialUI experiment

This repository is a playground to experiment with the aformentioned combination of libraries to see how we can build "real world" SPAs using FSMs (finite state machines) for state management.

## Getting started
At first setup
```shell
yarn
```

To run and serve at http://localhost:8080
```shell
yarn start
```
